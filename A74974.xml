            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Eader, this ≈ømall Treati≈øe was 30 yeares ≈øince written and publi≈øhed by my Father now decea≈øed; his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent was to di≈ø≈øwade a prophanation of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and to per≈øwade a re≈øtitution of Tithes and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriations to the Church; Wherein although he was not ≈øo happy as with Saint <hi>Peter</hi> at once to convert thou≈øands, yet was he not with him ≈øo in≈øucce≈ø≈øefull, as to fi≈øh all might and catch nothing; for ≈øome were per≈øwaded with what is written, nor can I ≈øay that others beleeved not; but rather thinke, that like the young man in the Go≈øpell, they went heavy away, becau≈øe they had too great po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øions to re≈øtore.</p>
            <p>Mi≈øcheifes are with more ea≈øe prevented then cured, men ≈øooner di≈ø≈øwaded from a reception, then per≈øwaded to a re≈øtitution. While therefore the great di≈ø≈øolution of <hi>Bi≈øhopricks</hi> and <hi>Deanaries</hi> is onely threatned not acted, I have cau≈øed a reimpre≈ø≈øion of this Tract, hopeing that (as at fir≈øt) it will finde ≈øome beleevers, and the rather becau≈øe written long ≈øince, by one, no <hi>Levite,</hi> him≈øelfe and children as his Ance≈øtours meere Lay-men, not having nor hopeing for any Eccle≈øia≈øticall preferrement, and therefore I am confident he tooke his motives ≈øolely from the dictates of religion and con≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, him≈øelfe practi≈øing what he would per≈øwade thee. I know thy argument for retaining impropriations, Abbeys &amp;c. is, the Law hath made them lay-fees, thou did≈øt legally buy them, and therefore maye≈øt lawfully keepe them.</p>
            <p>I confe≈ø≈øe our Statutes of Di≈ø≈øolution have changed the cour≈øe of the fee, from a politicke ≈øucce≈ø≈øion to a naturall de≈øcent; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily put a lay man in to the Prei≈øts place.

            <p>Now con≈øider, that if under the <hi>Leviticall Law,</hi> which in this was morall and not taken away, the ≈øingle act of <hi>devoting thy hou≈øe to the Lord,</hi> conferred ≈øuch a <hi>Sanctity,</hi> ≈øuch a <hi>Holine≈ø≈øe</hi> upon it, that it could never be redeemed, but at a fifth part more then the worth, and that valued by the <hi>Prie≈øt,</hi> ≈øhall the <hi>Founders guift,</hi> (which was the dedication in the <hi>Leviticall Law</hi>) the <hi>fervent Prayers</hi> and <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øions</hi> of the <hi>Clergy</hi> and <hi>Church,</hi> the long and frequen <hi>admini≈øtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Service</hi> and <hi>Sacraments</hi> under the <hi>Gospell,</hi> ≈øhall the≈øe adde nothing of <hi>Sanctity,</hi> nothing of <hi>Reverence</hi> to it; But even where thy <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Grandfathers</hi> for many hundreds of yeares reverently on their <hi>knees</hi> received <hi>my≈øtically</hi> the <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Bloud</hi> of <hi>Chri≈øt,</hi> there thou (to avoyd <hi>≈øuper≈øtition</hi>) do≈øt ≈øacrilegiou≈øly feed thy <hi>Oxe,</hi> and thy <hi>A≈ø≈øe,</hi> and not permitting <hi>Chri≈øt,</hi> as at fir≈øt, to lye between them, but more uncivill then the <hi>Jewi≈øh ho≈øt,</hi> turne≈øt him out to make roome for them.</p>
            <p>But thou wilt ≈øay the≈øe <hi>Abbies,</hi> the≈øe <hi>Mona≈øteries</hi> were Founded and dedicated by <hi>Idolatrous Per≈øons,</hi> Con≈øecrated by <hi>Popi≈øh Bi≈øhops,</hi> and for <hi>≈øuper≈øtitious u≈øes,</hi> and therefore not <hi>≈øacred,</hi> nor acceptable to God.</p>

            <p> But e're I depart from this place of Scripture; let mee note one thing more out of it, for the greater reverence of Churches: that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though our Lord be here ≈øaid, to have ca≈øt the≈øe things out of the Temple; yet, in truth, they were not in the Temple it ≈øelfe, but in the outward court or yard thereof. For within the inward parts of the Temple, (namely, the fir≈øt, and ≈øecond Tabernacles) did no man en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but the <hi>Levite Prie≈øts:</hi>

The <hi>third,</hi> was for ≈øimple wor≈øhip, praier, and doctrine (without any pompe or ceremony:) and the place of this, was the <hi>outward Court,</hi> (called,<note n="*" place="margin">1.

               <hi>Solomons porch;</hi>) which therefore had in it no <hi>Ceremoniall</hi> implement at all.</p>
            <p>The <hi>two</hi> fir≈øt of the≈øe functions, with the places belonging to them; were indeed particularly appropriat to the Law. For, they were <hi>Ceremoniall, My≈øticall, Secret, Leviticall, Judaicall,</hi> and <hi>Temporall, Ceremoniall,</hi> as celebrated with much worldly pompe. <hi>My≈øticall,</hi> as figurating ≈øome ≈øpirituall things. <hi>Secret;</hi> as either performed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde the Veile or Curtaine: or el≈øe ≈øeque≈øtred and remote from the people. <hi>Leviticall;</hi> as committed onely to the admini≈øtration of that <hi>Tribe. Judaicall;</hi> as ordained onely for the ≈øalvation of that people. And <hi>Temporall;</hi> as ju≈øtituted onely for a ≈øea≈øon, and not to continue. But the <hi>Sanctification,</hi> of the third <hi>function,</hi> and of the place thereto appointed, was directly contrary in all the points alleadged to the former two. <hi>Fir≈øt</hi> (as I ≈øaid before) it was for <hi>≈øimple wor≈øhip, Praier,</hi> and <hi>Doctrine,</hi> which were there to be performed and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in all <hi>≈øincerity,</hi> without any <hi>ceremony</hi> or <hi>ceremoniall</hi> implement u≈øed therein. <hi>Secondly,</hi> there was no matter of <hi>my≈øtery</hi> therein to be ≈øeene: but what≈øoever was <hi>my≈øticall</hi> in the Law, or the Prophets, was there expounded. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> nothing there, was hidden or ≈øecret from the people, but acted wholly without the <hi>Veile,</hi> and publikely for every man. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> it was not appropriate to the <hi>Levites,</hi> but common alike to all the Tribes. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> not ordained for the <hi>Jewes</hi> particularly, but for all Nations in generall. And <hi>la≈øtly,</hi> not to endure for a time, (as tho≈øe other two of the Law) but to continne for ever: even after the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were called, as well as the <hi>Jewes:</hi> that is, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time of the Go≈øpell, as well as the Law. Therefore, ≈øaith God, by <hi>I≈øaias</hi> the Prophet, <hi>cap.</hi> 56. 7. <hi>My hou≈øe ≈øhall be called an hou≈øe of Praier, to all Nations.</hi> He ≈øaid not, an <hi>Hou≈øe of Sacrifice to all Nations:</hi> for the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> ended before the calling of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and ≈øo they could have no part thereof. Nor an <hi>Hou≈øe of Praier</hi> for
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:113568:26"/>the <hi>Iewes</hi> onely, for then had the <hi>Gentiles</hi> (when they were called) beene likewi≈øe excluded. But an <hi>Hou≈øe of praier to all Nations,</hi> that is, <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> indifferently: which therefore, mu≈øt have relation to the times of the <hi>Go≈øpell.</hi> And con≈øequently, the <hi>≈øanctification</hi> of that hou≈øe, and of that <hi>function,</hi> is al≈øo a <hi>≈øanctification</hi> of the Churches of the Go≈øpell.</p>
            <p>We read not therefore, that Chri≈øt reformed any thing in the other two functions of the <hi>Temple;</hi> for they were now, as at an end. But becau≈øe this third function was for ever to continue to his Church: therefore he purgeth it of that that prophaned it; re≈øtoreth it (as he did marriage) to the originall ≈øanctitie: And that the future world (which was the time of the Go≈øpell) might better ob≈øerve it, then the precedent, and the time of the Law had done; he reporteth, &amp; confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the <hi>decree,</hi> whereby it was ≈øanctified: <hi>It is written,</hi> ≈øaith he, (as producing the record and words of the foundation) <hi>My hou≈øe ≈øhall be called an hou≈øe of praier to all people.</hi> He ≈øaith, <hi>My Hou≈øe,</hi> as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding all other, from having any property therein; for, God will be Ioynt-tenant with no man. And it ≈øhall be, <hi>An hou≈øe of praier for all people:</hi> that is, publike for ever; not private, nor appropriate to any: nor a <hi>denne of theeves;</hi> that is, no place of Merchandi≈øe, or ≈øecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar bu≈øine≈ø≈øe, as Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> expoundeth it. It mu≈øt not be an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriation; no man can, or may hold it in that kind.</p>
            <p>The time al≈øo when our Saviour pronounced the≈øe words is much to the purpo≈øe, as it ≈øeemeth to me. For it was after he had turned out the oxen and doves; that is, the things for the <hi>Sacrifice.</hi> As though he thereby taught us, that when the <hi>Sacrificall</hi> function of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was ended, yet the <hi>≈øanctification</hi> thereof, to be an hou≈øe of prayer, for ever remained.</p>
            <p n="11">11.<note place="margin">Saint Paul maintaineth the reverence of the Church.</note> This doctrine of our Saviour, is continued unto us by Saint <hi>Paul:</hi> who ≈øeeing the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to profane the Church with eating and drinking in it: though much good might follow thereby, (being orderly done) as the encrea≈øing of amity, and the reliefe of the poor; yet becau≈øe it was again≈øt the reverence of the place: he not onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveth them for it, demanding if they had not hou≈øes to eat and drinke in at home,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.12.</note> but skaring them al≈øo (by ≈øhewing the danger they were falling into) he ≈øpeaketh to them as with admiration: <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpi≈øe ye the Church of God?</hi> As if he ≈øhould ≈øay, is your religion now come unto that? or is that your Religion, <hi>To de≈øpi≈øe the place that

            <p>Some will ≈øay, I have u≈øed too much ≈øalt and vineger in this di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour≈øe; and that I have bent the great Artillery of Gods judgements and threatnings, <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>pon a peece of too light importance.

                  <hi>Nicolaus de Lyra,</hi> who flouri≈øhed about the ≈øame time, our own country-man, (though of <hi>Jewi≈øh</hi> Parents) a ≈øtarre al≈øo in that age of the fir≈øt magnitude, for his learning; and exqui≈øit above all in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> (it being his mother tongue, and elaborate by him) who≈øe judgement I the rather e≈øteeme, for that <hi>Luther</hi> loved him and preferred him above all interpreters, as <hi>Luther</hi> him≈øelfe te≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth in the 2 and 9 <hi>chap. of Gene≈øts.</hi> He (I ≈øay, as before I have noted) expoundeth it: fir≈øt, and properly for the <hi>Temple</hi> (under which I under≈øtand all things dedicated unto God) then for <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øalem,</hi> becau≈øe (≈øaith he) <hi>the Temple was there:</hi> and la≈øtly by <hi>con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence</hi> (for that is his owne word) <hi>for the Land of Judaea, who≈øe cheife City Jeru≈øalem was.</hi> So that he maketh the <hi>Temple</hi> and things belonging to God, to be the maine part whereat the Prophet aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and the City and Countrey to follow but by inferance and implication.</p>
               <p>Come to the later Writers, <hi>Genebrard</hi> noteth upon <hi>Sanctuari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um Dei;</hi> that the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word is, <hi>Habitacula,</hi> and for the <hi>po≈øtill</hi> ≈øaith; <hi>Generaliter de divinis omnibus templis, urbibus, locis, &amp; oppi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis populi Dei.</hi> So that if he had beene que≈øtioned further; how he under≈øtood <hi>Habitacula, ≈øpecialiter,</hi> it is then like he would have an≈øwered, <hi>de divinis omnibus templis tant√πm:</hi> that is, <hi>only of Churches.</hi> But be it as it is, he ≈øetteth them in the fir≈øt place, as the proper ≈øignification, and the re≈øt in con≈øequence, as <hi>analogicall,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Augu≈øtine</hi> and our Country-man <hi>Lyranus.</hi>

               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:113568:38"/>
               <p> To conclude, becau≈øe the newe≈øt things are mo≈øt acceptable with many. The la≈øt man that hath written upon the <hi>P≈øalter, Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinus</hi> a Je≈øuit, (and therefore I will not pre≈ø≈øe his authority) yet to doe him right, very well e≈øteemed among≈øt great Clerkes of our owne Church for much good learning (though in matters of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trover≈øie, full enough of Romi≈øh leaven) reciteth ≈øomewhat more breifly the former interpretations of <hi>Petrus Damianus, Hugo Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinalis,</hi> and <hi>John Vitalis,</hi> and approving tho≈øe their applications, putteth them ≈øtill on into the world, as truly con≈øonant to the tenor of the P≈øalme, which notwith≈øtanding I doubt not hath al≈øo many other expo≈øitions, as herbes have u≈øually divers virtues and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. But thus the elde≈øt and newe≈øt expo≈øitors are wholly for me, many al≈øo (and of the be≈øt of them) of the middle ages, none that I know again≈øt me. For although <hi>Mu≈øculus, Bucer, Calvin, Marlorat, Mollerus,</hi> expoundeth this P≈øalme hi≈øtorically of the Countrey and Nation of the Jewes, yet when they apply it to the Church of Chri≈øt (as otherwi≈øe there were no u≈øe of it) they make that application by way of figure and <hi>analogy;</hi> And then is there no cau≈øe to rai≈øe an <hi>antithe≈øis,</hi> or contrariety betweene them and me. For to reconcile the matter, Saint <hi>Jerome</hi> in his entrance into the expo≈øition of this P≈øalme, telleth us, that we may expound it figuratively of the Church (which I under≈øtand in matters of acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, gouernment, doctrine,) <hi>or hi≈øtorically of the people of the Jewes and nations</hi> about them. And though <hi>Calvin</hi> him≈øelfe pur≈øueth for the mo≈øt part the hi≈øtoricall interpretation, yet when he commeth to the 12. ver≈øe, he ≈øaith; <hi>Iterum accu≈øat profanos homines ≈øacrile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gij, qu√≤d praedatori√¢ licenti√¢ involant in ip≈øam Dei haereditatem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus much, and too much touching this point. As it is ≈øaid in the end of the <hi>Macchabees: If I have done well, and as the ≈øtory re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, it is the thing that I de≈øired: but if I have ≈øpoken ≈ølenderly and barely, it is that I could.</hi> Let no man therefore rely upon me, but learne of them that are bound to teach; <hi>For the Prei≈øts lips ≈øhould pre≈øerve knowledge, and they ≈øhould ≈øeeke the law at his mouth: for he is the me≈ø≈øenger of the Lord of Ho≈øts. Mal.</hi> 2.7.</p>
               <p>Other things there be, wherein I would willingly have enlarged my ≈øelfe a little: but as <hi>Papilius in Livy</hi> de≈øcribing a circle about <hi>Antiochus</hi> enforced him to an≈øwere before he ≈øtept out of it. So the Printer (having printed all to the la≈øt Sheet before I knew it) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtraineth me, <hi>ad articulum temporis,</hi> within which accordingly I mu≈øt needs end.</p>
